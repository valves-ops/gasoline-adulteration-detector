# Gasoline Adulteration Detector

Prototype of a simple portable device to detect ethanol adultered gasoline.

WARNING: Most of the documentation for this project is in Portuguese.


## Overview
In countries such as Brazil, gasoline comes as a mixture of both pure gasoline and Ethanol in order to optimize the fuel octane rating. 
But due to ethanol cheaper prices, some gas stations increase the concentration of ethanol on the gasoline they sell, trespassing both 
legislation and technical specifications. The consequences of this practice range from lower fuel performance up to engine parts damage.
The goal of this project is to create a cheap, portable device that give consumers the power to audit themselves the gasoline they buy.

To achieve the before mentioned goal, the device exploits the difference in condudctivity of gasoline and ethanol. By measuring the conductivity
of ethanol and gasoline mixture, it can infer the proportion of each. 


## Architecture
The device is composed of three main components: the exciter, the meter and the controller. 
The exciter is responsible to drive an alternate current through the fuel being measured, while the meter performs analogic
processing of the signal generated by the exciter to reduce analogic conversion quatization noise. The controller coordinates both
the excitation and A/D conversion, processes the incoming data and report the results to the user.
