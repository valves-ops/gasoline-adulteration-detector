# Gasoline Adulteration Detector

Prototype of a simple portable device to detect ethanol adultered gasoline.

WARNING: Most of the documentation for this project is in Portuguese.


## Overview
In countries such as Brazil, gasoline comes as a mixture of both pure gasoline and Ethanol in order to optimize the fuel octane rating. 
But due to ethanol cheaper prices, some gas stations increase the concentration of ethanol on the gasoline they sell, trespassing both 
legislation and technical specifications. The consequences of this practice range from lower fuel performance up to engine parts damage.
The goal of this project is to create a cheap, portable device that give consumers the power to audit themselves the gasoline they buy.

To achieve the before mentioned goal, the device exploits the difference in condudctivity of gasoline and ethanol. By measuring the conductivity
of ethanol and gasoline mixture, it can infer the proportion of each. 


## Architecture
The device is composed of three main components: the exciter, the meter and the controller. 
The exciter is responsible to drive an alternate current through the fuel being measured, while the meter performs analogic
processing of the signal generated by the exciter to reduce analogic conversion quatization noise. The controller coordinates both
the excitation and A/D conversion, processes the incoming data and report the results to the user.

## Documentation & Repository Structure
* **General Documentation**: this projected was developed as part of Electrical Engineering undergraduation discipline, therefore, all the work is documented in Portuguese in the final report (report.pdf)
* **Schematics**: also inside the final report
* **Controller Code**: controller.ino file
* **Project Parameters Calculation Spreadsheet**: a simple spreadsheet with all the parameters calculation formulas implemented
* **Curve Fitting and Result Analysis Notebook**: jupyter notebook containing the procedure for curve fitting and a brief statistical analysis of the device measurement precision


## Known Issues and Future Work
 * **Probe Casing**: the lack of a probe casing does not garantee that the geometry of the electrodes surroundings stays invariant, thus causing significant variability on measures taken through different probe positions with respect to the fluid recipient.
 * **Temperature Consideration**: both ethanol and gasoline conductivities vary with temperature, therefore it is necessary to include a thermometer on the probe to account for it.
 * **Fuel aging**: during test it was observed that after a few weeks the fuel samples changed their conductivity. The reason this transformation took place is not kown, and poses a challenge to the scope of applicability of this device.
